        <h1> The comfort of Nike shoes</h1>
        <p>Most of our picks were made from looking at the most highly rated and reviewed shoes via the Nike website 
            from a comfort perspective, as the best way to get a feel for what you are considering buying is to look 
            at the reviews from those who have purchased. We also asked a couple of people on the ONE37pm team their
             personal experiences with the most comfortable Nikes they've bought for a few of our picks as well.<p>

       <p> We also referred to a 2021 footwear study conducted by Hylton B. Menz and Daniel R. Bonanno, entitled
             Journal of Foot and Ankle Research. While a lot of the findings from this study were a bit fragmented,
              they did come to a few conclusions that are helpful for identifying comfortable shoes. They found that
               well-fitted, lightweight shoes with soft midsoles and curved rocker-soles are generally perceived to
                be most comfortable." </p>
